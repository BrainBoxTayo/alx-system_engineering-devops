# COMMAND CHALLENGE

## sftp protocol usage:
1. I used the Ubuntu 20.04 sandbox for the task
1. I then used the sftp command-line tool thus:
```bash
sftp username@hostname
```
after which I was prompted to enter my password
1. I then used the put command to transfer the screenshots from my local machine to the sandbox __/root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/__ folder
```bash
put *.png .
```
1. and pushed the changes to GITHUB
